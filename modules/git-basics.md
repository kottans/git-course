## Why mastering this?

Having this module passed you will have mastered some basic
Git skills.

You may think of it as of not only a starting set of git skills 
required for a developer to have but also as of an opportunity
to start and populate your developer's portfolio and
back up system.

## Targets

Having this module completed you would know
the effect of the commands listed and
also know how to accomplish some typical tasks.

The classification below is heavily opinionated, yet
you will benefit from mastering all of the below described.

When mastering Git basics check yourself against
the list below.

### Absolute minimum

- Git commands: `init, clone, add, commit, checkout, branch, merge, push, pull`
- documentation: MarkDown 

### Must know

Git commands: `fetch`

## Learn

1. Pass [Version Control with Git](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/)
   at Udacity to learn or refresh:
   - What is Version Control?
   - Create a Git Repo
   - Review a Repo's History
   - Add Commits To a Repo
   - Tagging, Branching, Merging
   - Undoing Changes
2. Complete following levels at [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
   - Main: Introduction Section
   - Remotes: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes
3. Markdown is a simple syntax to create nicely formatted 
   technical documentation with ease. It is support by GitHub,
   GitLab and Bitbucket. Check and bookmark for your future reference
   [MarkDown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

:gift: Did you know, Trello, Slack, Telegram and many other tools
support MarkDown to a great extent?
JIRA also uses notation similar to MarkDown yet different in many
aspects.

Wonna see what MarkDown syntax is used to design a particular document?
Navigate to it in the browser
(e.g. [git-basics.md](https://github.com/kottans/git-course/blob/master/modules/git-basics.md))
and click button **Raw** in the file's top bar. You will see the file's guts
(e.g. [git-basics.md source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kottans/git-course/master/modules/git-basics.md))

### Extra materials

1. [Git Screencast [rus]](https://learn.javascript.ru/screencast/git) -
   72 tiny videos (~3 minutes each) - select the topics that were
   not clear to you from the materials above
1. [Visualizing Git Sandbox](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) -
   also offers pre-sets available from a dropdown in the upper left corner
1. [Git Cheatsheets](https://services.github.com/on-demand/resources/cheatsheets/)

## Do

Time for practice. Git can be used not only for code but
for the documentation as well.

1. On GitHUb under create a repo
   named `kottans-git-course`.
   GitHub will suggest adding `README.md`.
   **Do not** do this. We need an empty repo. 
1. Clone the repo locally.
1. Create `README.md` in the project root and complete it using
   MarkDown markup notation:
   - Add `# Kottans Git Course` title.
   - Add `## Git Basics` module title.
   - Describe 2 or 3 things that
     * were new to you
     * were familiar but you have seen them at a different angle
     * were not so easy to master or comprehend

Any of your writings above can be done in a language you
feel most comfortable with. Try sticking to English though.

## When completed

When done let others know you have passed this module.

This lets other know your progress and probably someone
will ask you for some help in this module.

Where to communicate? In a chat you came here from :)
